This project enhance user productivity through task automation and information retrieval capabilities.The proposed desktop assistant integrates natural lanuage processing(NLP) algorithms and machine learning techniques to understand user commands, execute tasks, and retrive requested information. 

1. INTRODUCTION :
In our project, we mainly use voice as communication means, so the basically the speech recognition application. User can ask their assistants questions, cantrol home autiomation devices and manage other basic tasks such as open application, websites, voice typing  with spoken commands. Generally speech recognizer is a machine which understands humans and their spoken word insome way and can act thereafter. A different aspect of speech recognition is to facilitate for people with functional disability or other kinds of handicap. To make their daily work easier, voice control could be helpful. With their voice they could operate the laptop or computer devices shutdown or operate some other applications of laptop. This leads to the discussion about intelligent computer where these operations can be made available for the common man as well as for handicapped.
